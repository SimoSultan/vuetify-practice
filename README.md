# Vuetify To Do

## Disclaimer

I do not own this software, this was just for fun and to learn how to use Vue, coming from React. If anyone would like me to take this down, let me know.

This app is a complete and exact copy of a tutorial created by [Danny Connell](https://github.com/dannyconnell) which I coded along with.

The great tutorial can be found [here](https://www.udemy.com/course/vuetify-vuejs-vuex/). I recommend it if you are wanting to learn Vue.

## Description

This app is a simple todo app, allowing a user to add, edit, set due dates, sort, search and delete tasks.
It has an about page with lorem ipsum to learn about Vue Router, and a basic nav bar menu. Data is stored in the user's browser using [Localbase](https://github.com/dannyconnell/localbase). I intend to implement a BE with Golang and MySQL instead of using Localbase.
